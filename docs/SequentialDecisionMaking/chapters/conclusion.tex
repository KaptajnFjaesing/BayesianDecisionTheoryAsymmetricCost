\section{Conclusion}
Assuming a company has a cost function on the form of definition \ref{def:cost}, they can use the PER in comparison with their current decision policy to i) gauge the expected improvement by implementing the optimal policy or alternatively tune the value of $R$ for their values of $\frac{c}{h}$. The PER shown in figure \ref{fig:per} indicate that for $\frac{c}{h}\gg 1$ the optimal policy yields a reduction of $\sim 10\%$ in expected cost. In case a company is not using decision theory in a formal way, the expected cost reduction may be significantly higher.
